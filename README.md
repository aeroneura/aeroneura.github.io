# üöÄ Full-Stack Web Application ‚Äì MERN, MEAN, Flask (with PWA Support)

A robust, full-featured **Full Stack Web Application** built using the **MERN**, **MEAN**, and **Flask** stacks. This project demonstrates the implementation of scalable, maintainable applications across **JavaScript** and **Python** ecosystems with features such as authentication, RESTful APIs, media uploads, and responsive UI. Additionally, this project has been enhanced to include **PWA (Progressive Web App)** capabilities for offline functionality and installability.
